# QuPath instanseg extension

Development setup:

- Clone my qupath fork https://github.com/alanocallaghan/qupath
  - If you have the main qupath repo cloned already, you could add it as a remote `git add remote alan git@github.com:alanocallaghan/qupath.git && git fetch alan`
  - If you want to make a fresh clone, then continue, the following instructions should still work
  - Switch to branch `instanseg`
    - If you added a remote, then `git checkout instanseg`
- Clone this repo in the same directory
- Run QuPath
- Open extension
- Enter the path to the model file in "Downloaded model directory" (yes, I know, but for now :))
- Run...?
